         <h2>About</h2>
         <p>I've worked as a contractor for 7 years building secure, reliable, and scalable web applications. I value
            hard won tribal knowledge that comes of sticking with the same team, cross-cultural teamwork, and software that
            supports real human mission and purpose. Great software should feel invisible and empowering.</p>
