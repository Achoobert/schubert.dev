         <h2>Distributed Internet Monitoring Proof of Concept</h2>

         <h3>The Challenge</h3>
         <p>A global organization needs to quantify problematic internet at remote locations. The original plan was for
            BigQuery + PowerBI integration, but organizational momentum was lacking until there was a working proof of
            concept.</p>

         <h3>My Approach: Spike Solution</h3>
         <p>I built a rapid prototype using existing open-source components, focusing on <strong>decision-making over
               perfection</strong>.</p>

         <h3>Key Decisions Made</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Leverage Existing Work:</strong> Started with Geerling's internet-pi project (90% of what we
               needed), focused on the missing 10%: distributed data collection and automated updates</li>
            <li><strong>Skip PowerBI Integration:</strong> Early scope decision: PowerBI interface was outside efficient
               development scope. Chose Looker Studio for visualization POC (faster to implement)</li>
            <li><strong>Use Personal Google Account:</strong> Organization lacked access/approval for me. Built
               proof of concept with personal account to demonstrate value</li>
            <li><strong>Optimize for Data Volume:</strong> Initial version: 10,000 records per night (unusable).
               Solution: Single record per device every 5 minutes with unique device IDs</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Technical Challenges & Quick Wins</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>DNS Breaking on Install:</strong> Problem: Playbook broke DNS resolution. Solution: Check for
               systemd-resolved symlink before modifying resolv.conf. <strong>Decision:</strong> Fix the immediate
               blocker, not redesign the system</li>
            <li><strong>Container Health Checks:</strong> Problem: Services marked unhealthy despite running. Solution:
               Adjusted health check parameters. <strong>Decision:</strong> Make it work, not perfect</li>
            <li><strong>Credential Management:</strong> Problem: Complex setup process. Solution: Interactive script
               with secure defaults. <strong>Decision:</strong> Good enough for PoC, improve later</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Results</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Working prototype</strong> in 2 weeks</li>
            <li><strong>Data flowing</strong> to BigQuery from multiple locations</li>
            <li><strong>Visualization</strong> in Looker Studio</li>
            <li><strong>Automated updates</strong> via systemd service</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Lessons for Rapid Prototyping</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Scope Aggressively:</strong> PowerBI integration would have taken me weeks to learn. Looker
               Studio took hours. <strong>Decision:</strong> Prove value first, polish later</li>
            <li><strong>Use What Works:</strong> Geerling's project handled 90% of requirements. Focused on the unique
               10% (distributed collection). <strong>Decision:</strong> Don't rebuild, extend</li>
            <li><strong>Accept Technical Debt:</strong> GitHub Actions for CI/CD (unsuitable for production, but
               terrific for getting rapid feedback). Personal Google account for BigQuery. <strong>Decision:</strong>
               Get it working, production concerns come later</li>
            <li><strong>Get something working early:</strong> 10,000 overnight records → lead to implementing 1 record
               per device per 5 minutes. Discover issues fast!</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Impact</h3>
         <p>The proof of concept demonstrated:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Feasibility</strong> of distributed monitoring</li>
            <li><strong>Value</strong> of centralized data collection</li>
            <li><strong>Need</strong> for organizational support</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Next Steps</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Simplify installation process</li>
            <li>Move to organizational Google account</li>
            <li>Production-ready CI/CD pipeline</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
         <p><strong>Proof of concepts should prove visible value, not perfection.</strong> Focus on the critical path,
            accept technical debt, and optimize for demonstration over production readiness.</p>
